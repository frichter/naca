23 genes were differentially expressed in all skNAC−/− hearts, 17 of which are currently annotated genes. 
Decreased, gone: skNAC, Irx4 (IRXA3), Myoglobin (MB, PVALB), Periostin (POSTN, PN, OSF-2), Cxcl12 (Sdf-1), kcne1 (JLNS2, LQT5, JLNS, LQT2/5, MINK, ISK), Myh7 (MYHCB), Myh2 (MYH2A)
up:
Krt2.8, Shox2, Myh4
Normal: Smyd1, Hand2



1) look at coexpression module: both L3LVOTO and HLHS_subtype. pink + 176 genes in both

2) look at DE gene up/down: MB and MYH2 down with p < 0.05, 13% probability of occurring by chance

3) look at absolute expression values
